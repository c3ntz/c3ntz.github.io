## Learning objectives  

* To create a 3rd game using both JavaScript & Canvas in the aftermath of HangMan & PewPew  
* To divide our workload in the smartest way, meaning no one has to feel left out  
* To shape the whole project while abiding by a list of instructions  
* To deliver our very own version of this clicker game

## Group organization  

The least we can say is we benefitted from a great team chemistry throughout the whole project, so much so that we kept grinding to the very end. Though it proved difficult to divide the workload in such a way that everyone could feel satisfied, we let the group prevail over personal preferences.  

While Thibaut tends to work as a back-end dev, he took charge of the whole styling process. As for Sarah, she committed to the whole Canvas part. Zaccaria and Anthony both worked their way through the back-end part. We're bound to improve some aspects of the game asap, given that the current version lacks some of the features we thought of.  

## Project deployment  

The game benefits from its own Github Page, which we deemed the best way to render it accessible to whomever would wish to give it a try. Should you be unfamiliar with the core principles of the Cookie Clicker game, feel free to compare our version to [the original one](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)! Anyway, here's a snap of our [Spatial Clicker](https://kaleidosport.github.io/Cookie-Clicker/). â†´
